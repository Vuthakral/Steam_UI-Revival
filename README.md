## Steam UI Revival
A modification of the Steam UI's css code to create a visual mimicry of the old Steam UI, while keeping most features of the new UI.

Please note this css code is originally based upon the "[Metro skin for new Steam chat and friends UI](https://github.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat)" by RoseTheFlower

## To Install:

#### Windows:
**1)** Download & run the [patcher]() to enable the use of custom friends/chat skins.
**2)** Download the css file from this github project
**3)** Place the downloaded css file into the steam\clientui\ folder
**4)** Close your Steam chat & Friends list windows, then right click your task tray icon for Steam to re-open them.

#### Linux & Overpriced Tin:
Copypaste the code of the custom css into the Steam\skins\yourskinname\resource\webkit.css file
